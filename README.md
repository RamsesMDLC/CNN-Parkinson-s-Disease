## Dataset
* Tabular data. MS Excel file (csv format).
* 402005 rows of data (i.e., 402005 cars).
* The dataset contains biomedical voice measurements from subjects with early-stage  Parkinson's  disease  recruited  to  a  six-month  trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression of Parkinson's disease  (Kancharla  Naveen  Kumar,  2023;  UCI  Machine  Learning Repository, no date).

In the context of a regression task applied to biomedical speech measurements of 
subjects with early-stage Parkinson's Disease, the performance of the model and the 
knowledge  about  the  most  important  features  of  the  model  are  crucial  for  its 
widespread  implementation  among  healthcare professionals  in the  detection  and 
treatment  of  Parkinson's  Disease.  In  this  project,  the  machine  learning  model  of 
Boosted  Trees  was  applied  to  a  numeric  tabular  data  set,  and  the  deep  learning 
technique of convolutional neural networks was applied to images of 224x224 pixels, 
which were previously a numeric tabular dataset. The Boosted Trees model achieved 
a Mean Absolute Error of 1.21 for the training phase and 1.23 for the testing phase 
on  the  metric  tabular  dataset;  meanwhile,  the  convolutional  neural  network 
achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 6.43 for the training phase and 6.52 for the testing 
phase on the image dataset. In addition, both models display 8 features in common 
in the top 10 features that have more impact on model prediction according to the 
Mean Shapley Value technique. The aim of providing healthcare professionals with 
an  effective,  robust,  and  easy-to-use  technological  tool,  while  at  the  same  time 
figuring  out  the  most  relevant  features  in  the  context  of  biomedical  speech 
measurements  of  subjects  with  early-stage  Parkinson's  Disease,  was  achieved 
through the machine learning model of Boosted Trees. Furthermore, the evidence 
suggests  that  changes  in  the  hyperparameters  and/or  architecture  of  the 
convolutional neural network are probably required, or the transformation of the 
numeric tabular data into images may not have been optimal, negatively impacting 
the convolutional neural networkâ€™s performance
